                Our Story</p>
            <p>In a world where everything you could ever want is at the tip of your fingertips, it still seems so hard to find just the right person who checks off every box. mithi is a networking service that collects the perfect matches that fulfill your greatest desires.
            </p>
            <p>Founded by Alexa Reyes, mithi is a product of the exploration of the greatest desires from Asian women:</p>
                <p>"Growing up as a Filipino-American woman, I found myself being expected to fit into so many different expectations that simply did not seem to be attainable for me. I was warned to not get too fat at the ripe age of 13, as it would hinder my prospects at marriage to a handsome man. I was told to tone down my personal style because it made me look unapproachable. I knew I wasn't able to be their perfect match, so I decided to create a service that could find theirs. If I couldn't be the perfect daughter, granddaughter, niece, or romantic partner, then I could at least help others who found themselves to be  as unlucky as my familiars."</p>
      
            <p class="bold">
                How it Works</p>
            <p>When you sign up for mithi, we ask you a series of questions to generate the criteria of your perfect match.</p>
               <p>Inspired by the mail-order service, you will have the opportunity to easily browse a selection of your best matches and the option to propose courtship offers for a small fee per match. Once your match accepts, you will be able to communicate through our messaging system and allow your fantasies come to life.</p>
            <p>We understand that this is a large commitment, so we offer several options throughout the match generating process to guide you and present special deals with our alternative options that may suit you best.</p>
